## Technology Stack

- **React + TypeScript + Vite**  
  This minimal setup enables React to work seamlessly in Vite, providing faster development and efficient builds, with Hot Module Replacement (HMR) support.
- **Redux Toolkit**: A state management library for JavaScript applications, commonly used with React but also compatible with other frameworks.
- **React Router DOM**: A package that contains bindings for using React Router in web applications.
- **ESLint**: A static code analysis tool for identifying problematic patterns in JavaScript code, extended with various plugins.
- **Prettier**: A code formatter that ensures consistency in code style.
- **Husky**: A tool that can prevent bad `git commit`, `git push`, and more, using pre-commit hooks.
- **Vitest**: A delightful JavaScript Testing Framework focused on simplicity, supporting all types of testing - unit, integration, and end-to-end. In this project, Vitest is used to ensure code quality by allowing developers to write tests for components and functions to ensure they work as expected.
